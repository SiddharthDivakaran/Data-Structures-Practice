/*LRU Cache (Least Recently Used Cache)
 * In computing, cache replacement algorithms are optimizing algorithms that a computer program or a hardware maintained structure can follow in order to manage a cache of information stored on the computer. When the cache is full,
 * the algorithm must choose which items to discard to make room for the new ones.
 * Initially, when the cache has room for more pages, we keep on adding the pages to the cache.
 * But when cache is completely filled, then to add a new page, another page has to be removed.
 * So, a strategy needs to be used for replacing cache pages.
   LeaLeast Recently Used cache replacement algorithm is a cache replacement strategy by which the least recently accessed page 
   is removed from the cache when a new page is accessed which is not already present in the cache.
